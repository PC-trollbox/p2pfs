        <p><b>It is not quite peer-to-peer and uses Socket.IO.</b></p>
        <p>But your browser is still distributing files to other browsers, it just happens through a server. Because of that, it can be used with "non-hostable" IPs (IPs you can't host services on). You can see the <a href="https://github.com/PC-trollbox/p2pfs">source code</a>, and see that the Socket.IO server is actually just transmitting messages from clients to other clients. <b>So it is not true P2P, but still has some P2P features.</b></p>
        <p>For real P2P, you should look for something like Torrent: it is real P2P, and even more distributed than this service.</p>
